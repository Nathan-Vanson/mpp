## Description

**Molecular Property Prediction** (mpp) is a Python project developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis at the University of Geneva (UNIGE). The project focuses on analyzing binary paterns in data using various statistical, mathematical and machine learning techniques.

## Installation & Setup

To download and install the **mpp** project, you can use the following command:

1. **Clone the repository (SSH)** 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Nathan-Vanson/mpp.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
```bash
cd mpp
```

3. **Install the required dependencies**
> mpp uses Poetry for dependency management. If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it via pip :
```bash
pip install poetry
```
> Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
poetry install
```
> This will install all the required dependencies.

4. **Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommanded)**
> It's recommended to activate the virtual environment created by Poetry to isolate the project's dependencies:
```bash
poetry shell
```

## Additional Notes

Make sure **Python 3.10.x** is installed on your system as mpp is compatible with Python 3.10.x versions.
